# SmartPredict: Financial Forecasting for Competitive Trading - Team Project

## Project Overview

SmartPredict is a financial forecasting project aimed at helping **Move Tickers** provide smarter, data-driven trading recommendations to its customers. By leveraging machine learning and real-time financial datasets, our system predicts short-term price movements in NASDAQ-100 stocks, enabling more informed and competitive trading strategies.

The project culminates in an **interactive dashboard** that visualizes stock price predictions, market indicators, and key financial metrics in a format accessible even to users with basic financial literacy.

## Problem Statement

The stock market is inherently risky, and customers of firms like Move Tickers need accurate tools to navigate this complexity. Researching financial data manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Our solution offers:
- **Price movement predictions**
- **Earnings-based stock behavior analysis**
- **A clean dashboard UI for fast decision-making**

By combining AI predictions with UI design, we aim to give Move Tickers a real-time, interpretable edge in competitive trading.

## Data Sources

We primarily used engineered time-series features for each stock, such as moving averages, volatility, and earnings surprise indicators. Below is a summary of our key datasets:

## ðŸ’» Dashboard

The final deliverable is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that enables users to:

- Predict stock price direction (up/down) using a classification model  
- Estimate future closing prices using a regression model  
- Analyze company-level features like earnings surprises, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, and volatility  
- Explore macroeconomic context through indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and market volatility  
- Visualize model confidence using predicted probabilities  
- Compare actual vs predicted prices across time  
- Forecast future behavior based on the latest available feature vector  
- Select company and year dynamically, filter by date, and choose chart display options

##  Dashboard Usage Guide

The **SmartPredict Dashboard** provides an intuitive interface to explore stock predictions and analyze financial patterns interactively. Below is an overview of its key features and how to use them effectively.

### Whatâ€™s in the Dashboard?

![Dashboard Preview](images_readme/Dashboard_preview.png) 

**Dashboard Components:**

- **Primary Stock Ticker Dropdown**  
  Select NASDAQ-100 stock (e.g., AAPL, GOOG) to view its prediction and performance.

- **Enable Multi-Ticker Comparison (Optional)**  
  Toggle this to compare multiple stock predictions side by side.

- **Time Period Selector**  
  Choose the year (e.g., 2020) and month range (e.g., Janâ€“Dec) for which to analyze stock trends.

- **Chart Features**  
  - Show Actual Prices: Displays real stock prices from the selected period.  
  - Show Predicted Prices: Visualizes the model's predicted prices alongside actual data.  
  - Technical Indicators: Optionally display metrics like direction signals, confidence overlay
- 
- **Main Chart: Stock Price Analysis**  
  An interactive line chart showing:  
  - **Actual Price** (blue solid line)  
  - **Predicted Price** (orange dashed line)  
  This enables quick comparison between real-world data and model performance.

- **Tooltip for Help**  
  A help button on the top right provides tooltips about using the dashboard and its purpose.

![Selecting year](images_readme/selecting_year.png)
1. **Toggle chart options** to customize your view (e.g., enable/disable technical indicators or predicted prices).
![Chart features](images_readme/selecting_features.png)
1. **Interpret the Chart**:  
   - If the predicted line closely follows the actual price, the model has high accuracy.  
   - Use deviations to understand where the model might over/underestimate trends.
2. **Use the prediction for decision-making**: Combine with earnings and macro indicators for trading insights.

This dashboard bridges machine learning insights with user-friendly visuals to support data-backed investment strategies.

### Technologies Used:

- `streamlit` for UI and interactivity  
- `altair` for plotting actual vs predicted trends  
- `joblib` to load trained models  
- `scikit-learn` and `xgboost` for prediction logic  
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation

Example: Select a company like `GOOG`, choose a forecast date, and see both direction and price predictions for the next 5 trading days â€” along with classification probabilities and model accuracy.
